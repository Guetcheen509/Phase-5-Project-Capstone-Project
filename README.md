# Phase-5-Project-Capstone-Project
Capstone Project â€“ Credit Risk Prediction
 Description
This project aims to predict the loan repayment status based on financial and demographic data.
It covers the complete data science process, from exploratory data analysis to machine learning model evaluation.

 Objectives

Clean and prepare credit data.

Perform descriptive analysis to understand borrower characteristics.

Build and compare several predictive models.

Visualize insights in Power BI.

 Dataset

The dataset includes borrower information such as:

Loan amount, interest rate, employment duration, home ownership

Income, debt, account balances, and loan status (paid or defaulted)

 Models Tested

Random Forest,XGBoost,LightGBM, Logistic Regression


Performance was evaluated using three main metrics:

Accuracy, Recall, F1-Score

 
 Tools and Technologies

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM)

Power BI (descriptive analysis and visualization)

Jupyter Notebook


 Results
Model	Accuracy
Random Forest	0.9075
XGBoost	0.7768
LightGBM	0.6881
Logistic Regression	0.8600

The Random Forest model achieved the highest overall accuracy.

 Conclusion

This project highlights the key role of machine learning in credit risk management.
While model performance varies, the analytical approach and Power BI visualizations provide valuable insights into borrower behavior and loan performance.
